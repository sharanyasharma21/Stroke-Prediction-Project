# Stroke-Prediction-Project

#### Collaborators: Sharanya Sharma & Yuval Madne

This dataset was acquired from kaggle by fedesoriano, with the intention to educate others about the various factors that can potentially cause a stroke. As the World Health Organization claims strokes to be the 2nd leading cause of death in the world with a global death rate of 11%, prevention has gained increasing popularity. This data set considers 10 factors that can contribute to whether a person has a stroke or not. These factors include gender, age, hypertension, heart health (diseased or not), marriage status, work-type, residence-type, average glucose level, BMI, and smoking history. Using these factors, various statistical learning algorithms can be applied to predict the likelihood of a stroke. Since stroke is a binary outcome, where people can either have a stroke or not have a stroke, binary classification will be used. Methods to implement binary classification include k-NN, Ridge, Lasso, Trees/Random Forests, Boosting, LDA, and SVM. While each of these methods have their own benefits, we will compare the results of their predictions to see the overall trend of prediction.
